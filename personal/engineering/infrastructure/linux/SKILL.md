# Linux workflow

## When to use
Use for Linux environment inspection, configuration, troubleshooting, or automation.

## Personal principles
Inspect first, use narrow paths, and prefer reversible operations.

## Workflow
Inspect OS and process state, identify exact targets, make the smallest change, and verify service/filesystem state.

## Decision rules
Avoid broad recursive or destructive commands when a precise command exists.

## Constraints
Protect credentials, system files, and unrelated processes.

## Failure modes
If target ownership or scope is unclear, stop before mutation.

## Expected output
Report commands, target state, change, and verification.

## Validation
The intended service or environment state is observable after the change.
