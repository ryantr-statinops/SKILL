# AI engineering foundations

Use this skill to design an AI-enabled system as an engineered product rather than as a model demo. Keep the user outcome, data, model, context, tools, evaluation, and operational boundary explicit.

## Problem framing

- Define the user outcome and the decision or workflow being improved.
- Distinguish automation, prediction, classification, retrieval, generation, and decision support.
- Establish a non-AI baseline and identify when deterministic software is sufficient.
- Define error tolerance, human review, latency, privacy, and cost constraints.

## Model and system boundaries

Keep these components separate in the design:

- Data and data preparation.
- Model and model configuration.
- Prompt and context construction.
- Retrieval and embeddings.
- Tool calls and MCP integrations.
- Agent orchestration and memory.
- Application/backend boundary.
- Evaluation and monitoring.

Do not attribute application, retrieval, tool, or data failures to the model without isolating the boundary.

## ML foundations

Reason explicitly about dataset, labels, features, baseline, training/evaluation split, overfitting, generalization, model selection, leakage, distribution shift, offline evaluation, and online behavior. Separate prediction quality from causal claims and document assumptions.

## LLM and agent foundations

For LLM systems, define:

- Prompt and context construction.
- Structured output and validation.
- Embedding and retrieval behavior.
- RAG indexing, retrieval quality, and grounding.
- Tool calling, permissions, timeouts, and failure handling.
- Agent loop, stopping conditions, and human approval boundaries.
- Memory scope, retention, and privacy.

Use the smallest context and permission set that can achieve the user outcome.

## Evaluation

Build representative and boundary cases before relying on a model or agent. Evaluate the complete system where appropriate, including:

- Task success and correctness.
- Grounding and citation/attribution behavior.
- Structured output validity.
- Tool selection and argument safety.
- Refusal and escalation behavior.
- Latency, cost, rate limits, and reliability.
- Regression against previous prompts, models, data, and tools.

Keep offline tests separate from production observations and record uncertainty rather than presenting a small evaluation set as proof of general behavior.

## Production foundations

Plan inference, versioning, configuration, fallbacks, monitoring, privacy, safety, rate-limit handling, and cost controls. Make model, prompt, retrieval, tool, and data versions observable enough to reproduce a failure. Define rollout, rollback, and human approval boundaries before exposing side effects.

## Decision rules

- Do not choose a model before defining the user outcome and baseline.
- Do not add an agent loop when a deterministic call or workflow is sufficient.
- Do not grant tools or context broader permissions than the task requires.
- Do not treat a successful demo as evidence of production reliability.
- Do not hide retrieval, tool, or data-quality failures behind a generic model error.
- Do not create a specialized RAG, agent, MCP, or MLOps route until repeated work justifies a separate skill.

## Failure modes

Stop or narrow the design when:

- The outcome, evaluator, or acceptable failure behavior is unclear.
- Training/evaluation data can leak future or target information.
- Tool permissions, side effects, or human approval boundaries are unspecified.
- Cost, latency, privacy, or rate-limit constraints are ignored.
- A production decision depends on an unvalidated offline metric.

## Expected output

Provide the user outcome, non-AI baseline, system boundary, data/model/context/tool design, evaluation plan, production constraints, safety and approval boundaries, and unresolved risks.

## Validation

The design has a measurable outcome, representative and boundary evaluations, isolated failure boundaries, explicit permissions, and a plan to observe and reproduce production behavior.

## Agent handoff

- Selected when: Use only for initial AI/agent engineering framing described by this draft scaffold.
- Do not activate when: Do not activate for production AI implementation until a reviewed leaf skill exists.
- Expected output: State the foundation scope, missing capability, and safe next step.
- User-facing report: Explain the scaffold limitation, assumptions, and any common skill used instead.
- Confirmation boundary: Ask before destructive, external, or irreversible actions.
