# Repository onboarding

## When to use
Use at the start of work in an unfamiliar or recently changed repository.

## When not to use
Do not repeat a full onboarding pass when current project context is already verified.

## Workflow
1. Inspect top-level files and project documentation.
2. Read applicable agent instructions and contribution rules.
3. Check Git state, branch, remote, and recent changes.
4. Locate the relevant entrypoints, tests, configuration, and build commands.
5. Summarize findings, risks, and the smallest next step.

## Decision rules
- Trust repository evidence over assumptions.
- Read only files relevant to the requested task after the initial map.

## Safety constraints
Preserve uncommitted work and do not modify files during inspection.

## Failure modes
If instructions or entrypoints conflict, surface the conflict before editing.

## Expected output
Return a concise repository map, relevant conventions, current state, and proposed scope.

## Validation
Confirm that the relevant files and commands were identified before proceeding.
